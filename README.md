# Fastr-Loader
Loader for Fastr

This repository is used to work on Fastr's loader, which is only used in the roblox model version of Fastr.

### Why?

Roblox has recently pushed a change requiring that roblox models cannot use `require(id)` in it's code, making it nessesary to rewrite Fastr's loader.
